# Web-Applications-course
This is my personal repository for Web Applications Development course assignments, 7th semester, Computer Science Engineering Created on April 6th, 2021.

**Assignment 1 (Tarea 1)**
---

This first assignment of this course is the development of a web application prototype, which is focused on an insect sighting record (view _enunciado-tarea1.pdf_). This web application is completely designed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

The web page consist of 4 main pages:
- the _portada.html_ main page. We can see the last 5 insect sighting records with their photos and types.
- the _avistamientos.html_ page. Here we can see with more detail all of the insect sighting records with all of the info.
- the _informar.html_ page. Here we can send a record of an insect.
- the _stats.html_ page. Here we can see the stats of the insect sighting records.


This protoype does not use a database to save the information sended, so by the moment all of the graphs and records are pre-fabricated. To run this application, just run the file _**portada.html**_, which is the main page of this software.

**Assignment 2 (Tarea 2)**
---

The second assignment of this course is the extension of the previous project using databases and python. The following pages include now a database using python and printing HTML files using python:
- the _portada.html_ main page. Now we can see the last 5 insect sighting records of the database with their photos and types.
- the _avistamientos.html_ page. Here we can see with more detail all of the insect sighting records of the database with all of the info.
- the _informar.html_ page. Here we can send a record of an insect.
- the _stats.html_ page. Here we can see the stats of the insect sighting records. This graphs are still photos.

To run this application, change the credentials of the database called in the .py files (cgi-bin) with the ones you want to use on your own locally, then just run the file _**portada.html**_, which is the main page of this software.


**Assignment 3 (Tarea 3)**
---

On this assignment we extend the previous work, adding a map on the main page of the application and some graphs based on the information saved in the database.

To run this application, change the credentials of the database called in the .py files (cgi-bin) with the ones you want to use on your own locally, then just run the file _**portada.html**_, which is the main page of this software.
